# Better Local Co-op Map for Outward
Simple mod for Outward that allows a player to keep moving and interacting ingame while the map has been opened by another player in local co-op.

## How to install

1. Make sure you have [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) installed first. If having trouble with that part, reading the [mods installation guide](https://outward.fandom.com/wiki/Installing_Mods) in Outward Fandom might be worth a read.
2. Place the [mod's dll](https://github.com/renan-hath/Outward-Better-Local-Co-op-Map/releases) in your BepInEx plugins folder, and you're good to go!
